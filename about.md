## SHL Shot Maps

Welcome to the SHL Shot maps project. This app gives you the ability to browse all the teams in the Swedish Hockey League season 17/18 and generate density plots of all shot attempts taken or conceded by a single team, or by any number of teams of your liking.

### How to use it
The app is quite easy to use. The boxes on the left under the analysis tab allows you to choose which shots to display. Tick the boxes for all teams whose shots you want to display. If you want to look at all shots taken against a specific team, tick all boxes for under "Team" and only the team whose defense you wish to investigate under "Defending team".

### Data
The data displayed contains only shots taken in the 5v5 game situation. Thus, no boxplay, power play, 4v4 or situations where either team has taken their goaltender are included.

Enjoy!
